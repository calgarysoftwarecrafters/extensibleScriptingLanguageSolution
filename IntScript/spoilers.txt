Spoiler Warning!
If you want to figure out how to fix the tests on your own close this file.







The initial run of the tests will cause all three tests to fail with the same NPE.

The init method in the ScriptRunnerTests file passes null to the ScriptRunner.  You will need to implement the OpLoader
interface and modify the init method to construct and pass an instance of your implementation to the ScriptRunner.

To implement the OpLoader interface you will need to have implementations of the Op interface to return from the loader.

The tests assume that the Add & Sub ops exist.
